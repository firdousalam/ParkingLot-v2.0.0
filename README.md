# ParkingLot-v2.0.0
ParkingLot v2.0.0 Nature of the Game We want to understand how you think as a programmer, and the level of craft you  bring to bear when building software. Of course, the ideal would be a real world problem, with real scale, but that isnâ€™t  practical as it would take too much time. So instead we have a dead simple, high  school level problem that we want you to solve as though it was a real-world  problem. Please note that not following the instructions below will result in an automated  rejection. Taking longer than the time allocated will negatively affect our evaluation of  your submission.
